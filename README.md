# CheckPoint
The goal of our project is to create user-friendly application that will help people manage their budget.  
The "Smart Money" project includes a user-friendly interface, data security, absence of advertisements, and free customer support. However, the main advantage of our program is simplicity. To start managing your finances wisely, you don't need to have financial expertise or understand how to navigate a website and make choices. With just a few clicks, our application will make your life easier and show you new possibilities.  
It's also worth noting that our application does not require any data from your bank cards. Furthermore, all your expense inputs into the application remain within the app and are not disclosed!

The development of our project started on September 12, 2023, but our goal is to release the project by the end of the year!
